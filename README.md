# CODETECH-IT--PUSH-BUTTON-COUNTER-TASK-1

NAME : THOUFICK S

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

INTERN ID : CT08QOF

DOMAIN : EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

DURATION :  FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

OVERVIEW : PUSH-BUTTON-COUNTER

### **Objective:**
To design a button press counter using an Arduino UNO, I2C LCD display, and an LED indicator. The system increments the count each time the button is pressed and displays it on the LCD while blinking an LED as feedback.

### **Key Elements:**
1. Push Button Input – Detects button presses to increase the counter.
2. Debounce Mechanism – Ensures accurate button press detection.
3. LCD Display (I2C) – Displays the count value dynamically.
4. LED Indication – Blinks when the button is pressed for user feedback.
5. Arduino UNO – Controls the logic and processes button inputs.

### **Technology Used:**
1. Arduino UNO – Microcontroller for processing inputs and outputs.
2. C++ (Arduino IDE) – Programming language for coding the microcontroller.
3. LiquidCrystal_I2C Library – For interfacing the I2C LCD display.
4. Digital Input/Output – Button and LED control using Arduino’s GPIO pins.
